# ✈️ UAV Flight Path Optimizer

A multi-language simulation and optimization system for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning. This project combines the strengths of **C++**, **Java**, and **Rust** to build a highly modular, high-performance flight simulation console application with ASCII UI inspired by Metasploit.

## 🧠 Overview

**UAV Flight Path Optimizer** is a console-based tool designed to simulate terrain navigation, AI-based flight behavior, and pathfinding for UAVs and autonomous aircraft. It includes:

- Real-time flight simulations
- Metasploit-style ASCII graphics
- Interactive terrain and pathfinding system
- AI-based decision modeling (Java)
- Performance-critical flight logic (Rust)
